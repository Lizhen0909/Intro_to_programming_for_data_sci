    "- Must be an HTML file rendered using Quarto (1.5 pts). \n",
    "\n",
    "- There aren’t excessively long outputs of extraneous information (e.g. no printouts of unnecessary results without good reason, there aren’t long printouts of which iteration a loop is on, there aren’t long sections of commented-out code, etc.) (1 pt)\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no piece of unnecessary / redundant code, and no unnecessary / redundant text (1 pt)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code should be commented and clearly written with intuitive variable names. For example, use variable names such as number_input, factor, hours, instead of a,b,xyz, etc. (1.5 pts)\n",
