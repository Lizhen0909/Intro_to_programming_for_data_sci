You can access Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda Navigator, or directly open the Jupyter Notebook application itself. It should automatically open up in your default browser. The figure below shows a Jupyter Notebook opened with Google Chrome. This page is called the landing page of the notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new notebook, click on the New button and select the Python 3 option. You should see a blank notebook as in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Writing and executing code\nCode cell: By default, a cell is of type Code, i.e., for typing code, as seen as the default choice in the dropdown menu below the Widgets tab. Try typing a line of python code (say, 2+3) in an empty code cell and execute it by pressing Shift+Enter. This should execute the code, and create an new code cell. Pressing Ctlr+Enter for Windows (or Cmd+Enter for Mac) will execute the code without creating a new cell.\nCommenting code in a code cell: Comments should be made while writing the code to explain the purpose of the code or a brief explanation of the tasks being performed by the code. A comment can be added in a code cell by preceding it with a # sign. For example, see the comment in the code below.\nWriting comments will help other users understand your code. It is also useful for the coder to keep track of the tasks being performed by their code.\n\n#This code adds 3 and 5\n3+5\n\n8\n\n\nMarkdown cell: Although a comment can be written in a code cell, a code cell cannot be used for writing headings/sub-headings, and is not appropriate for writing lengthy chunks of text. In such cases, change the cell type to Markdown from the dropdown menu below the Widgets tab. Use any markdown cheat sheet found online, for example, this one to format text in the markdown cells.\nGive a name to the notebook by clicking on the text, which says ‘Untitled’.\n\n\n1.2.3 Saving and loading notebooks\nSave the notebook by clicking on File, and selecting Save as, or clicking on the Save and Checkpoint icon (below the File tab). Your notebook will be saved as a file with an exptension ipynb. This file will contain all the code as well as the outputs, and can be loaded and edited by a Jupyter user. To load an existing Jupyter notebook, navigate to the folder of the notebook on the landing page, and then click on the file to open it.\n\n\n1.2.4 Rendering notebook as HTML\nWe’ll use Quarto to print the **.ipynb* file as HTML. Check the procedure for rendering a notebook as HTML here. You have several options to format the file.\nYou will need to open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the command: quarto render filename.ipynb --to html."

    "text": "1.4 Python libraries\nThere are several built-in functions in python like print(), abs(), max(), sum() etc., which do not require importing any library. However, these functions will typically be insufficient for a analyzing data. Some of the popular libraries in data science and their primary purposes are as follows:\n\nNumPy: Performing numerical operations and efficiently storing numerical data.\nPandas: Reading, cleaning and manipulating data.\nMatplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizing data.\nSciPy: Performing scientific computing such as solving differential equations, optimization, statistical tests, etc.\nScikit-learn: Data pre-processing and machine learning, with a focus on prediction.\nStatsmodels: Developing statistical models with a focus on inference\n\nA library can be imported using the import keyword. For example, a NumPy library can be imported as:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nUsing the as keyboard, the NumPy library has been given the name np. All the functions and attributes of the library can be called using the ‘np.’ prefix. For example, let us generate a sequence of whole numbers upto 10 using the NumPy function arange():\n\nnp.arange(8)\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n\nGenerating random numbers is very useful in python for performing simulations (we’ll see in later chapters). The library random is used to generate random numbers such as integers, real numbers based on different probability distributions, etc.\nBelow is an example of using the randint() function of the library for generating random numbers in [a, b], where a and b are integers.\n\nimport random as rm\nrm.randint(5,10) #This will generate a random number in [5,10]\n\n7"

However, the value of x can be changed:\n\nx = 3\nprint(\"x =\", x)\n\nx = 3\n\n\nThus, the object x in the above code is a variable that refers to a memory location storing the constant value of 3.\n\n2.2.1 Variable names\nThere are a some rules for naming variables:\n\nA variable name must start with a letter or underscore _\nA variable name may consist of letters, numbers, and underscores only\n\nFor example, some of the valid variable names are *salary, text10, _varname. Some of the invalid variable names are salary% 10text, varname)*\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. For example, the variable Varname will be different from varname.\nThere are certain reserved words in python that have some meaning, and cannot be used as variable names. These reserved words are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest coding practice: Variables should be named such that they are informative of the value they are storing. For example, suppose we wish to compute the income tax a person has to pay based on their income and tax rate. Below are two ways of naming variables to do this computation:\n\nincome = 80000\ntax_rate = 0.15\nprint(\"Income tax = \",income*tax_rate)\n\nIncome tax =  12000.0\n\n\n\na = 80000\nb = 0.15\nprint(\"Income tax = \",a*b)\n\nIncome tax =  12000.0\n\n\nThe former code chuck is better than the latter one as it makes the code easy to read and understand.\n\n\n2.2.2 Practice exercise 2\n\n2.2.2.1 \nIn the statements below, classify the objects as variables or constants?\n\nvalue = “name”\nconstant = 7\nanother_const = “variable”\nTrue_False = True\n\nWhich of the following variable names are valid?\n\nvar.name\nvar9name\n_varname\nvarname*"

For example, consider the variable called annual_income in the code below:\n\nannual_income = \"80000\"\n\nSuppose we wish to divide annual_income by 12 to get the monthly income. We cannot use the variable monthly_income directly as its datatype is a string and not a number. Thus, numerical operations cannnot be performed on the variable annual_income.\nWe’ll need to convert annual_income to an integer. For that we will use the python’s in-built int() function:\n\nannual_income = int(annual_income)\nmonthly_income = annual_income/12\nprint(\"monthly income = \", monthly_income)\n\nmonthly income =  6666.666666666667\n\n\nSimilarly, datatypes can be converted from one type to another using in-built python functions as shown below:\n\n#Converting integer to string\nstr(9)\n\n'9'\n\n\n\n#Converting string to float\nfloat(\"4.5\")\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n#Converting bool to integer\nint(True)\n\n1\n\n\nSometimes, conversion of a value may not be possible. For example, it is not possible to convert the variable greeting defined below to a number:\n\ngreeting = \"hello\"\n\nHowever, in some cases, mathematical operators such as + and * can be applied on strings. The operator + concatenates multiple strings, while the operator * can be used to concatenate a string to itself multiple times:\n\n\"Hi\" + \" there!\"\n\n'Hi there!'\n\n\n\n\"5\" + '3'\n\n'53'\n\n\n\n\"5\"*8\n\n'55555555'"

    "text": "2.8 Programming errors\nThere are 3 types of errors that can occur in a program - syntax errors, run-time errors, and semantic errors.\n\n2.8.1 Syntax errors\nSyntax errors occur if the code is written in a way that it does not comply with the rules / standards / laws of the language (python in this case). For example, suppose a values is assigned to a variable as follows:\n\n9value = 2\n\nThe above code when executed will indicate a syntax error as it violates the rule that a varible name must not start with a number.\n\n\n2.8.2 Run-time errors\nRun-time errors occur when a code is syntactically correct, but there are other issues with the code such as:\n\nMisspelled or incorrectly capitalized variable and function names\nAttempts to perform operations (such as math operations) on data of the wrong type (ex. attempting to subtract two variables that hold string values)\nDividing by zero\nAttempts to use a type conversion function such as int on a value that can’t be converted to an int\n\nFor example, suppose a number is multipled as follws:\n\nmultiplication_result = x * 4\n\nThe above code is syntactically correct. However, it will generate an error as the variable x has not been defined as a number.\n\n\n2.8.3 Semantic errors\nSemantic errors occur when the code executes without an error being indicated by the compiler. However, it does not work as inteded by the user. For example, consider the following code of mutiplying the number 6 by 3:\n\nx = '6'\nx * 3\n\n'666'\n\n\nIf it was intended to multiply the number 6, then the variable x should have been defined as x=6 so that x has a value of type integer. However, in the above code 6 is a string type value. When a string is multiplied by an integer, say n, it concatenates with itself n times.\n\n\n2.8.4 Practice exercise 6\nSuppose we wish to compute tax using the income and the tax rate. Identify the type of error from amongst syntax error, semantic error and run-time error in the following pieces of code.\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 * Income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 x income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 ** income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)"
