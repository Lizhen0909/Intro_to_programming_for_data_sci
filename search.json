    "text": "1.2 Jupyter notebook\n\n1.2.1 Introduction\nJupyter notebook is an interactive platform, where you can write code and text, and make visualizations. You can access Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda Navigator, or directly open the Jupyter Notebook application itself. It should automatically open up in your default browser. The figure below shows a Jupyter Notebook opened with Google Chrome. This page is called the landing page of the notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new notebook, click on the New button and select the Python 3 option. You should see a blank notebook as in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Writing and executing code\nCode cell: By default, a cell is of type Code, i.e., for typing code, as seen as the default choice in the dropdown menu below the Widgets tab. Try typing a line of python code (say, 2+3) in an empty code cell and execute it by pressing Shift+Enter. This should execute the code, and create an new code cell. Pressing Ctlr+Enter for Windows (or Cmd+Enter for Mac) will execute the code without creating a new cell.\nCommenting code in a code cell: Comments should be made while writing the code to explain the purpose of the code or a brief explanation of the tasks being performed by the code. A comment can be added in a code cell by preceding it with a # sign. For example, see the comment in the code below.\nWriting comments will help other users understand your code. It is also useful for the coder to keep track of the tasks being performed by their code.\n\n#This code adds 3 and 5\n3+5\n\n8\n\n\nMarkdown cell: Although a comment can be written in a code cell, a code cell cannot be used for writing headings/sub-headings, and is not appropriate for writing lengthy chunks of text. In such cases, change the cell type to Markdown from the dropdown menu below the Widgets tab. Use any markdown cheat sheet found online, for example, this one to format text in the markdown cells.\nGive a name to the notebook by clicking on the text, which says ‘Untitled’.\n\n\n1.2.3 Saving and loading notebooks\nSave the notebook by clicking on File, and selecting Save as, or clicking on the Save and Checkpoint icon (below the File tab). Your notebook will be saved as a file with an exptension ipynb. This file will contain all the code as well as the outputs, and can be loaded and edited by a Jupyter user. To load an existing Jupyter notebook, navigate to the folder of the notebook on the landing page, and then click on the file to open it.\n\n\n1.2.4 Rendering notebook as HTML\nWe’ll use Quarto to print the **.ipynb* file as HTML. Check the procedure for rendering a notebook as HTML here. You have several options to format the file. Here are some points to remember when using Quarto to render your notebook as HTML:\n\nThe Raw NBConvert cell type is used to render different code formats into HTML or LaTeX. This information is stored in the notebook metadata and converted appropriately. Use this cell type to put the desired formatting settings for the HTML file.\nIn the formatting settings, remember to use the setting embed-resources: true. This will ensure that the rendered HTML file is self-contained, and is not dependent on other files. This is especially important when you are sending the HTML file to someone, or uploading it somewhere. If the file is self-contained, then you can send the file by itself without having to attach the dependent files with it.\n\nOnce you have entered the desired formatting setting in the Raw NBConver cell, you are ready to render the notebook to HTML. Open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the notebook (.ipynb file), and use the command: quarto render filename.ipynb --to html.",

    "text": "1.4 Python libraries\nThere are several built-in functions in python like print(), abs(), max(), sum() etc., which do not require importing any library. However, these functions will typically be insufficient for a analyzing data. Some of the popular libraries in data science and their primary purposes are as follows:\n\nNumPy: Performing numerical operations and efficiently storing numerical data.\nPandas: Reading, cleaning and manipulating data.\nMatplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizing data.\nSciPy: Performing scientific computing such as solving differential equations, optimization, statistical tests, etc.\nScikit-learn: Data pre-processing and machine learning, with a focus on prediction.\nStatsmodels: Developing statistical models with a focus on inference\n\nA library can be imported using the import keyword. For example, a NumPy library can be imported as:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nUsing the as keyword, the NumPy library has been given the name np. All the functions and attributes of the library can be called using the ‘np.’ prefix. For example, let us generate a sequence of whole numbers upto 10 using the NumPy function arange():\n\nnp.arange(8)\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n\nGenerating random numbers is very useful in python for performing simulations (we’ll see in later chapters). The library random is used to generate random numbers such as integers, real numbers based on different probability distributions, etc.\nBelow is an example of using the randint() function of the library for generating random numbers in [a, b], where a and b are integers.\n\nimport random as rm\nrm.randint(5,10) #This will generate a random number in [5,10]\n\n7",

However, the value of x can be changed:\n\nx = 3\nprint(\"x =\", x)\n\nx = 3\n\n\nThus, the object x in the above code is a variable that refers to a memory location storing the constant value of 3.\n\n2.2.1 Variable names\nThere are a some rules for naming variables:\n\nA variable name must start with a letter or underscore _\nA variable name may consist of letters, numbers, and underscores only\n\nFor example, some of the valid variable names are salary, text10, _varname. Some of the invalid variable names are salary%, 10text, varname).\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. For example, the variable Varname will be different from varname.\nThere are certain reserved words in python that have some meaning, and cannot be used as variable names. These reserved words are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest coding practice: Variables should be named such that they are informative of the value they are storing. For example, suppose we wish to compute the income tax a person has to pay based on their income and tax rate. Below are two ways of naming variables to do this computation:\n\nincome = 80000\ntax_rate = 0.15\nprint(\"Income tax = \", income*tax_rate)\n\nIncome tax =  12000.0\n\n\n\na = 80000\nb = 0.15\nprint(\"Income tax = \",a*b)\n\nIncome tax =  12000.0\n\n\nThe former code chunk is better than the latter one as it makes the code easy to read and understand.\nPython style guide: Please refer to the python style guide for best coding practices, such as naming variables, using spaces, tabs, and styling the different components of your code.\n\n\n2.2.2 Practice exercise 2\n\n2.2.2.1 Variables or constants?\nIn the statements below, classify the objects as variables or constants?\n\nvalue = “name”\nconstant = 7\nanother_const = “variable”\nTrue_False = True\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Valid variable names?\nWhich of the following variable names are valid?\n\nvar.name\nvar9name\n_varname\nvarname*",

For example, consider the variable called annual_income in the code below:\n\nannual_income = \"80000\"\n\nSuppose we wish to divide annual_income by 12 to get the monthly income. We cannot use the variable monthly_income directly as its datatype is a string and not a number. Thus, numerical operations cannnot be performed on the variable annual_income.\nWe’ll need to convert annual_income to an integer. For that we will use the python’s in-built int() function:\n\nannual_income = int(annual_income)\nmonthly_income = annual_income/12\nprint(\"monthly income = \", monthly_income)\n\nmonthly income =  6666.666666666667\n\n\nSimilarly, datatypes can be converted from one type to another using in-built python functions as shown below:\n\n#Converting integer to string\nstr(9)\n\n'9'\n\n\n\n#Converting string to float\nfloat(\"4.5\")\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n#Converting bool to integer\nint(True)\n\n1\n\n\nSometimes, conversion of a value may not be possible. For example, it is not possible to convert the variable greeting defined below to a number:\n\ngreeting = \"hello\"\n\nHowever, in some cases, mathematical operators such as + and * can be applied on strings. The operator + concatenates multiple strings, while the operator * can be used to concatenate a string to itself multiple times:\n\n\"Hi\" + \" there!\"\n\n'Hi there!'\n\n\n\n\"5\" + '3'\n\n'53'\n\n\n\n\"5\"*8\n\n'55555555'",

    "text": "2.8 Programming errors\nThere are 3 types of errors that can occur in a program - syntax errors, run-time errors, and semantic errors.\n\n2.8.1 Syntax errors\nSyntax errors occur if the code is written in a way that it does not comply with the rules / standards / laws of the language (python in this case). For example, suppose a values is assigned to a variable as follows:\n\n9value = 2\n\nThe above code when executed will indicate a syntax error as it violates the rule that a variable name must not start with a number.\n\n\n2.8.2 Run-time errors\nRun-time errors occur when a code is syntactically correct, but there are other issues with the code such as:\n\nMisspelled or incorrectly capitalized variable and function names\nAttempts to perform operations (such as math operations) on data of the wrong type (ex. attempting to subtract two variables that hold string values)\nDividing by zero\nAttempts to use a type conversion function such as int on a value that can’t be converted to an int\n\nFor example, suppose a number is multipled as follws:\n\nmultiplication_result = x * 4\n\nThe above code is syntactically correct. However, it will generate an error as the variable x has not been defined as a number.\n\n\n2.8.3 Semantic errors\nSemantic errors occur when the code executes without an error being indicated by the compiler. However, it does not work as inteded by the user. For example, consider the following code of mutiplying the number 6 by 3:\n\nx = '6'\nx * 3\n\n'666'\n\n\nIf it was intended to multiply the number 6, then the variable x should have been defined as x=6 so that x has a value of type integer. However, in the above code 6 is a string type value. When a string is multiplied by an integer, say n, it concatenates with itself n times.\n\n\n2.8.4 Practice exercise 6\nSuppose we wish to compute tax using the income and the tax rate. Identify the type of error from amongst syntax error, semantic error and run-time error in the following pieces of code.\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 * Income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 x income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 ** income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)",

The logical operator and is used to check if all the conditions are true, while the logical operator or is used to check if either of the conditons is true.\n\n#Checking if both the conditions are true using 'and'\n5 == 5 and 67 == 68\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n#Checking if either condition is true using 'or'\nx = 6; y = 90\nx &lt; 0 or y &gt; 50\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 if-elif-else statement\nThe if-elif-else statements can check several conditions, and execute the code corresponding to the condition that is true. Note that there can be as many elif statements as required.\nSyntax: Python uses indentation to identify the code to be executed if a condition is true. All the code indented within a condition is executed if the condition is true.\nExample: Input an integer. Print whether it is positive or negative.\n\nnumber = input(\"Enter a number:\")  #Input an integer\nnumber_integer = int(number)       #Convert the integer to 'int' datatype\nif number_integer &gt; 0:               #Check if the integer is positive\n    print(\"Number is positive\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is negative\")\n\nEnter a number:-9\nNumber is negative\n\n\nIn the above code, note that anything entered by the user is taken as a string datatype by python. However, a string cannot be positive or negative. So, we converted the number input by the user to integer to check if it was positive or negative.\nThere may be multiple statements to be executed if a condition is true. See the example below.\nExample: Input a number. Print whether it is positive, negative or zero. If it is negative, print its absolute value.\n\nnumber = input(\"Enter a number:\")\nnumber_integer = int(number)\nif number_integer &gt; 0:\n    print(\"Number is positive\")\nelif number_integer == 0:\n    print(\"Number is zero\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is negative\")\n    print(\"Absolute value of number = \", abs(number_integer))\n\nEnter a number:0\nNumber is zero\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Practice exercise 1\nInput a number. Print whether its odd or even.\nSolution:\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nif num%2 == 0:           #Checking if the number is divisible by 2\n    print(\"Number is even\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is odd\")\n\nEnter a number: 5\nNumber is odd\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Try-except\nIf we suspect that some lines of code may produce an error, we can put them in a try block, and if an error does occur, we can use the except block to instead execute an alternative piece of code. This way the program will not stop if an error occurs within the try block, and instead will be directed to execute the code within the except block.\nExample: Input an integer from the user. If the user inputs a valid integer, print whether it is a multiple of 3. However, if the user does not input a valid integer, print a message saying that the input is invalid.\n\nnum = input(\"Enter an integer:\")\n\n#The code lines within the 'try' block will execute as long as they run without error  \ntry:\n    #Converting the input to integer, as user input is a string\n    num_int = int(num)  \n    \n    #checking if the integer is a multiple of 3\n    if num_int % 3 == 0:            \n        print(\"Number is a multiple of 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Number is not a multiple of 3\")\n        \n#The code lines within the 'except' block will execute only if the code lines within the 'try' block throw an error        \nexcept:\n    print(\"Input must be an integer\")\n\nEnter an integer:hi\nInput must be an integer\n\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Practice exercise 2\n\n3.1.6.1 \nAsk the user to enter their exam score. Print the grade based on their score as follows:\n\n\n\nScore\nGrade\n\n\n\n\n(90,100]\nA\n\n\n(80,90]\nB\n\n\n[0,80]\nC\n\n\n\nIf the user inputs a score which is not a number in [0,100], print invalid entry.\nSolution:\n\nscore = input(\"Enter exam score:\")\ntry:\n    \n    #As exam score can be a floating point number (such as 90.65), we need to use 'float' instead of 'int' to convert the user input to a floating point number\n    score_num = float(score)\n    if score_num &gt; 90 and score_num &lt;= 100:\n        print(\"Grade: A\")\n    elif score_num &gt; 80 and score_num &lt;= 90:\n        print(\"Grade: B\")\n    elif score_num &gt;= 0 and score_num &lt;= 80:\n        print(\"Grade: C\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid score\")     #If a number is less than 0 or more than 100\nexcept:\n    print(\"Invalid input\")         #If the input is not a number\n\nEnter exam score:90\nGrade: B\n\n\n\n\n3.1.6.2 \nNested if-elif-else statements: This question will lead you to create nested if statements, i.e., an if statement within another if statement.\nThink of a number in [1,5]. Ask the user to guess the number.\n\nIf the user guesses the number correctly, print “Correct in the first attempt!”, and stop the program. Otherwise, print “Incorrect! Try again” and give them another chance to guess the number.\nIf the user guesses the number correctly in the second attempt, print “Correct in the second attempt”, otherwise print “Incorrect in both the attempts, the correct number is:”, and print the correct number.\n\nSolution:\n\n#Let us say we think of the number. Now the user has to guess the number in two attempts.\nrand_no = 3\nguess = input(\"Guess the number:\")\nif int(guess)==rand_no:\n    print(\"Correct in the first attempt!\")\n    \n#If the guess is incorrect, the program will execute the code block below    \nelse:    \n    guess = input(\"Incorrect! Try again:\")\n    if int(guess) == rand_no:\n        print(\"Correct in the second attempt\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Incorrect in the both the attempts, the correct number was:\", rand_no)",

    "text": "3.2 Loops\nWith loops, a piece of code can be executed repeatedly for a fixed number of times or until a condition is satistified.\n\n3.2.1 for loop\nWith a for loop, a piece of code is executed a fixed number of times.\nWe typically use for loops with an in-built python function called range() that supports for loops. Below is its description.\nrange(): The range() function creates an iterative object that represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.\nThe advantage of the range type over a regular list or tuple is that a range object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the start, stop and step values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed).\nBelow is an example where the range() function is used to print over integers from 0 to 4.\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nNote that the range function itself doesn’t store the list of integers from 0 to 4; it is more memory-efficient by generating values on the fly.\nNote that the last element is one less than the integer specified in the range() function.\nUsing the range() function, the for loop can iterate over a sequence of numbers. See the example below.\nExample: Print the first n elements of the Fibonacci sequence, where n is an integer input by the user, such that n&gt;2. In a fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the preceding two numbers, and the sequence starts from 0,1. The sequence is as follows:\n0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,….\n\nn = int(input(\"Enter number of elements:\"))\n\n#Initializing the sequence to start from 0, 1\nn1 = 0;n2 = 1\n\n#Printing the first two numbers of the sequence\nprint(n1)\nprint(n2)\n\nfor i in range(n-2):  #Since two numbers of the sequence are already printed, n-2 numbers are required\n    \n    #Computing the next number of the sequence as the summation of the previous two numbers\n    n3 = n1 + n2\n    print(n3)\n    \n    #As 'n3' is already printed, it is no longer the next number of the sequence. \n    #Thus, we move the values of the variables n1 and n2 one place to the right to compute the next number of the sequence.\n    n1 = n2\n    n2 = n3  \n    \nprint(\"These are the first\", n, \"elements of the fibonacci series\")\n\nEnter number of elements:6\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\nThese are the first 6 elements of the fibonacci series\n\n\nAs in the if-elif-else statement, the for loop uses identation to indicate the piece of code to be run repeatedly.\nNote that we have used an in-built python function\n\n\n3.2.2 while loop\nWith a while loops, a piece of code is executed repeatedly until certain condition(s) hold.\nExample: Print all the elements of the Fibonacci sequence less than n, where n is an integer input by the user, such that n&gt;2.

As an analogy, if a human is a computer program, then the mind can be considered to be a function, which has purpose of thinking, eyes can be another function, which have a purpose of seeing. These functions are called upon by the human when needed.\nSimilarly, in case of a computer program, functions are a piece of code, that perform a specific task, when called upon by the program. Instead of being defined as a function, the piece of code can also be used directly whenever it is needed in a program. However, defining a frequently-used piece of code as a function has the following benefits:\nTo put it more formally, a function is a piece of code that takes arguments (if any) as input, performs computations or tasks, and then returns a result or results.",

However, sometimes we may wish to define a function that takes input(s), and performs computations on the inputs to produce an output. These input(s) are called parameter(s) of a function. When a function is called, the value(s) of these parameter(s) must be specified as argument(s) to the function.\n\n4.3.1 Function with a parameter\nLet us change the previous example to write a function that takes an integer as an input argument, and prints whether it is odd or even:\n\n#This is an example of a function definition that has an argument\ndef odd_even(num):           \n    if num%2==0:\n        print(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Odd\")\n\nWe can use the function whenever we wish to find a number is odd or even.

    "text": "4.4 Functions that return objects\nUntil now, we saw functions that print text. However, the functions did not return any object. For example, the function odd_even prints whether the number is odd or even. However, we did not save this information. In future, we may need to use the information that whether the number was odd or even. Thus, typically, we return an object from the function definition, which consists of the information we may need in the future.\nThe example odd_even can be updated to return the text “odd” or “even” as shown below:\n\n#This is an example of a function definition that has an argument with a default value, and returns an object\ndef odd_even(num=0):           \n    if num%2==0:\n        return(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        return(\"Odd\")\n\nThe function above returns a string “Odd” or “Even”, depending on whether the number is odd or even. This result can be stored in a variable, which can be used later.\n\nresponse=odd_even(3)\nresponse\n\n'Odd'\n\n\nThe variable response now refers to the object where the string “Odd” or “Even” is stored. Thus, the result of the computation is stored, and the variable can be used later on in the program. Note that the control flow exits the function as soon as the first return statement is executed.\nFigure 4.1 below shows the terminology associated with functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Terminology associated with functions",

However, there are some functions that come built-in with python and we can use them directly without defining them. These built-in functions can be see here. For example the built-in function max() computes the max of numeric values:\n\nmax(1,2,3)\n\n3\n\n\nAnother example is the round() function that rounds up floating point numbers:\n\nround(3.7)\n\n4",

These libraries are contributed by people around the world as python is an open-source platform. Some of the libraries popular in data science, and their purposes are the following:\n\nNumPy: Performing numerical operations and efficiently storing numerical data.\nPandas: Reading, cleaning and manipulating data.\nMatplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizing data.\nSciPy: Performing scientific computing such as solving differential equations, optimization, statistical tests, etc.\nScikit-learn: Data pre-processing and machine learning, with a focus on prediction.\nStatsmodels: Developing statistical models with a focus on inference\n\nA library can be imported using the import keyword. For example, a NumPy library can be imported as:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nUsing the as keyboard, the NumPy library has been given the name np. All the functions and attributes of the library can be called using the ‘np.’ prefix. For example, let us generate a sequence of whole numbers upto 10 using the NumPy function arange():\n\nnp.arange(8)\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n\nGenerating random numbers is very useful in python for performing simulations (we’ll see in later chapters). The library random is used to generate random numbers such as integers, real numbers based on different probability distributions, etc.\nBelow is an example of using the randint() function of the library for generating random numbers in [a, b], where a and b are integers.\n\nimport random as rm\nrm.randint(5,10) #This will generate a random number in [5,10]\n\n7\n\n\n\n4.7.1 Practice exercise 2\nGenerate a random number between [-5,5]. Do this 10,000 times. Find the mean of all the 10,000 random numbers generated.\nSolution:\n\nimport random as rm\ncounter = 0\nfor i in range(10000):\n    counter = counter + rm.uniform(-5,5)\nprint(\"Mean is:\", counter/10000)\n\nMean is: 0.061433810226516616",

This is because the + operator creates a new list, while the extend method adds elements to an existing list. Thus, the extend operator is more memory efficient.\n\nlist_example4 = [5,'hi',4]\nlist_example4.extend([None, '7', 9])\nlist_example4\n\n[5, 'hi', 4, None, '7', 9]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Sorting a list\nA list can be sorted using the sort method:\n\nlist_example5 = [6,78,9]\nlist_example5.sort(reverse=True) #the reverse argument is used to specify if the sorting is in ascending or descending order\nlist_example5\n\n[78, 9, 6]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.6 Slicing a list\nWe may extract or update a section of the list by passing the starting index (say start) and the stopping index (say stop) as start:stop to the index operator []. This is called slicing a list. For example, see the following example.\n\nlist_example6 = [4,7,3,5,7,1,5,87,5]\n\nLet us extract a slice containing all the elements from the the 3rd position to the 7th position.\n\nlist_example6[2:7]\n\n[3, 5, 7, 1, 5]\n\n\nNote that while the element at the start index is included, the element with the stop index is excluded in the above slice.\nIf either the start or stop index is not mentioned, the slicing will be done from the beginning or until the end of the list, respectively.\n\nlist_example6[:7]\n\n[4, 7, 3, 5, 7, 1, 5]\n\n\n\nlist_example6[2:]\n\n[3, 5, 7, 1, 5, 87, 5]\n\n\nTo slice the list relative to the end, we can use negative indices:\n\nlist_example6[-4:]\n\n[1, 5, 87, 5]\n\n\n\nlist_example6[-4:-2:]\n\n[1, 5]\n\n\nAn extra colon (‘:’) can be used to slice every ith element of a list.\n\n#Selecting every 3rd element of a list\nlist_example6[::3]\n\n[4, 5, 5]\n\n\n\n#Selecting every 3rd element of a list from the end\nlist_example6[::-3]\n\n[5, 1, 3]\n\n\n\n#Selecting every element of a list from the end or reversing a list \nlist_example6[::-1]\n\n[5, 87, 5, 1, 7, 5, 3, 7, 4]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.7 Practice exercise 4\nStart with the list [8,9,10]. Do the following:\n\n5.2.7.1 \nSet the second entry (index 1) to 17\n\nL = [8,9,10]\nL[1]=17\n\n\n\n5.2.7.2 \nAdd 4, 5, and 6 to the end of the list\n\nL = L+[4,5,6]\n\n\n\n5.2.7.3 \nRemove the first entry from the list\n\nL.pop(0)\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n5.2.7.4 \nSort the list\n\nL.sort()\n\n\n\n5.2.7.5 \nDouble the list (concatenate the list to itself)\n\nL=L+L\n\n\n\n5.2.7.6 \nInsert 25 at index 3\nThe final list should equal [4,5,6,25,10,17,4,5,6,10,17]\n\nL.insert(3,25)\nL\n\n[4, 5, 6, 25, 10, 17, 4, 5, 6, 10, 17]\n\n\nNow that we have an idea about lists, let us try to think where it can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        \n\n\nNow that we have learned about lists and tuples, let us compare them.\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Q2}}\\): A list seems to be much more flexible than tuple, and can replace a tuple almost everywhere. Then why use tuple at all?\n\\(\\color{blue}{\\text{A2}}\\): The additional flexibility of a list comes at the cost of efficiency. Some of the advatages of a tuple over a list are as follows:\n\nSince a list can be extended, space is over-allocated when creating a list. A tuple takes less storage space as compared to a list of the same length.\nTuples are not copied. If a tuple is assigned to another tuple, both tuples point to the same memory location. However, if a list is assigned to another list, a new list is created consuming the same memory space as the orignial list.\nTuples refer to their element directly, while in a list, there is an extra layer of pointers that refers to their elements. Thus it is faster to retrieve elements from a tuple.\n\nThe examples below illustrate the above advantages of a tuple.\n\n#Example showing tuples take less storage space than lists for the same elements\ntuple_ex = (1, 2, 'Obama')\nlist_ex = [1, 2, 'Obama']\nprint(\"Space taken by tuple =\",tuple_ex.__sizeof__(),\" bytes\")\nprint(\"Space taken by list =\",list_ex.__sizeof__(),\" bytes\")\n\nSpace taken by tuple = 48  bytes\nSpace taken by list = 64  bytes\n\n\n\n#Examples showing that a tuples are not copied, while lists can be copied\ntuple_copy = tuple(tuple_ex)\nprint(\"Is tuple_copy same as tuple_ex?\", tuple_ex is tuple_copy)\nlist_copy = list(list_ex)\nprint(\"Is list_copy same as list_ex?\",list_ex is list_copy)\n\nIs tuple_copy same as tuple_ex? True\nIs list_copy same as list_ex? False\n\n\n\n#Examples showing tuples takes lesser time to retrieve elements\nimport time as tm\ntt = tm.time()\nlist_ex = list(range(1000000)) #List containinig whole numbers upto 1 million\na=(list_ex[::-2])\nprint(\"Time take to retrieve every 2nd element from a list = \", tm.time()-tt)\n\ntt = tm.time()\ntuple_ex = tuple(range(1000000)) #tuple containinig whole numbers upto 1 million\na=(tuple_ex[::-2])\nprint(\"Time take to retrieve every 2nd element from a tuple = \", tm.time()-tt)\n\nTime take to retrieve every 2nd element from a list =  0.03579902648925781\nTime take to retrieve every 2nd element from a tuple =  0.02684164047241211",

    "text": "5.3 Dictionary\nA dictionary consists of key-value pairs, where the keys and values are python objects. While values can be any python object, keys need to be immutable python objects, like strings, integers, tuples, etc. Thus, a list can be a value, but not a key, as elements of list can be changed. A dictionary is defined using the keyword dict along with curly braces, colons to separate keys and values, and commas to separate elements of a dictionary:\n\ndict_example = {'USA':'Joe Biden', 'India':'Narendra Modi', 'China':'Xi Jinping'}\n\nElements of a dictionary can be retrieved by using the corresponding key.\n\ndict_example['India']\n\n'Narendra Modi'\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Adding and removing elements in a dictionary\nNew elements can be added to a dictionary by defining a key in square brackets and assiging it to a value:\n\ndict_example['Japan'] = 'Fumio Kishida'\ndict_example['Countries'] = 4\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida',\n 'Countries': 4}\n\n\nElements can be removed from the dictionary using the del method or the pop method:\n\n#Removing the element having key as 'Countries'\ndel dict_example['Countries']\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\n\n#Removing the element having key as 'USA'\ndict_example.pop('USA')\n\n'Joe Biden'\n\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'India': 'Narendra Modi', 'China': 'Xi Jinping', 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\nNew elements can be added, and values of exisiting keys can be changed using the update method:\n\ndict_example = {'USA':'Joe Biden', 'India':'Narendra Modi', 'China':'Xi Jinping','Countries':3}\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Countries': 3}\n\n\n\ndict_example.update({'Countries':4, 'Japan':'Fumio Kishida'})\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Countries': 4,\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Iterating over elements of a dictionary\nThe items() attribute of a dictionary can be used to iterate over elements of a dictionary.\n\nfor key,value in dict_example.items():\n    print(\"The Head of State of\",key,\"is\",value)\n\nThe Head of State of USA is Joe Biden\nThe Head of State of India is Narendra Modi\nThe Head of State of China is Xi Jinping\nThe Head of State of Countries is 4\nThe Head of State of Japan is Fumio Kishida\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Practice exercise 5\nThe GDP per capita of USA for most years from 1960 to 2021 is given by the dictionary D given in the code cell below.\nFind:\n\nThe GDP per capita in 2015\nThe GDP per capita of 2014 is missing.

    "text": "6.1 Object\nAn object consists of two items:\nWe have already seen several in-built python objects such as string objects, integer objects, float objects, list objects, tuple objects and dictionary objects, in previous chapters. Each of these objects have attributes and methods associated with them.\nFor example, consider a integer object named as integer_example.\ninteger_example = 5\nThe attributes and methods of this integer object can be seen by putting a . next to its name, and pressing the tab key. A dropdown menu consisting of the attributes and methods will appear as shown below.\nA list of all attributes and methods associated with an object can be obtained with the dir() function. Ignore the ones with underscores - these are used by Python itself. The rest of them can be used to perform operations.\n#This code is not executed to avoid printing a long list\ndir(integer_example)\nFor example, an attribute of integer_example is real, which contains the real part of the number:\ninteger_example.real\n\n5\nA example of a method of integer_example is as_integer_ratio(), which returns a tuple containing the numerator and denominator of the integer when it is expressed as a fraction.\ninteger_example.as_integer_ratio()\n\n(5, 1)\nNote that attributes do not have any parenthesis after them as they are just data, and cannot accept arguments. On the other hand methods have parenthesis after them as they are functions that may or may not have arguments.",

    "text": "6.2 Class\nA class is a template for objects. It contains the attributes and methods associated with the object of the class. As an analaogy, the class Cat will consist of characterisitcs (or attributes) shared by all cats such as breed, fur color, etc., as well as capability to perform functions (or methods) such as run, meow, etc.\nPlease see the python documentation for class.\nInstance: An instance is a specific realization of the object of a particular class. Continuing with the Cat analaogy of a class, a particular cat is an instance of the class Cat. Similarly, in the example above, the object integer_example is an instance of the class integer. The words object and instance are often used interchangeably.\nCreating an instance of a class is called Instantiation.\n\n6.2.1 Creating your own class\nUntil now we saw examples of in-built Python classes, such as integer, List, etc. Now, we’ll learn to create our own class that serves our purpose.\nBelow is a toy example of a class.\n\nclass ToyClass:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n    \n    def add(self):\n        return self.x + self.y\n    \n    def multiply(self):\n        return self.x*self.y\n\nWe’ll use the example above to explain the following terms:\n\nThe class statement: We use the class statement to create a class. The Python style guide recommends to use CamelCase for class names.\nThe constructor (or the __init__() method): A class typically has a method called __init__. This method is called a constructor and is automatically called when an object or instance of the class is created. The constructor initializes the attributes of the class. In the above example, the constructor accepts two values as arguments, and initializes its attributes x and y with those values.\nThe self argument: This is the first argument to every method in the class. Whenever the class refers to one of its attributes or methods, it must precede them by self. The purpose of self is to distinguish the class’s attributes and methods from other variables and functions in the program.\n\nThe class ToyClass consists of two attributes x and y, a constructor __init__(), and two methods add() and multiply().\nTo create an object or instance of the class ToyClass, we’ll use the class name with the values to be passed as argument to the constructor for initializing the object / instance.\n\ntoy_instance = ToyClass(6,12)\n\nThe x attribute of the class ToyClass can be called using the . operator with the object name:\n\ntoy_instance.x\n\n6\n\n\nTo use the multiply() method of the class ToyClass, we’ll use the . operator with the object name:\n\ntoy_instance.multiply()\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Example: A class that analyzes a string\nLet us create a class that analyzes a string.\n\nclass AnalyzeString:\n    \n    #Constructor\n    def __init__(self, s):\n        s = s.lower()\n        self.words = s.split()\n    \n    #This method counts the numebr of words\n    def number_of_words(self):\n        return (len(self.words))\n    \n    #This method counts the number of words starting with the string s\n    def starts_with(self,s):\n        return len([x for x in self.words if x[:len(s)]==s])\n    \n    #This method counts the number of words of length n\n    def words_with_length(self,n):\n        return len([x for x in self.words if len(x)==n])\n    \n    #This method returns the frequency of the word w\n    def word_frequency(self,w):\n        return self.words.count(w)\n\nLet us create an instance of the class AnalyzeString() to analyze a sentence.\n\n#Defining a string\nsentence = 'This sentence in an example of a string that we will analyse using a class we have defined'\n\n\n#Creating an instance of class AnalyzeString()\nsentence_analysis = AnalyzeString(sentence)\n\n\n#The attribute 'word' contains the list of words in the sentence\nsentence_analysis.words\n\n['this',\n 'sentence',\n 'in',\n 'an',\n 'example',\n 'of',\n 'a',\n 'string',\n 'that',\n 'we',\n 'will',\n 'analyse',\n 'using',\n 'a',\n 'class',\n 'we',\n 'have',\n 'defined']\n\n\n\n#The method 'word_frequncy()' provides the frequency of a word in the sentence\nsentnce_analysis.word_frequency('we')\n\n2\n\n\n\n#The method 'starts_with()' provides the frequency of number of words starting with a particular string\nsentnce_analysis.starts_with('th')\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Practice exercise 1\nWrite a class called PasswordManager. The class should have a list called old_passwords that holds all of the user’s past passwords. The last item of the list is the user’s current password. There should be a method called get_password that returns the current password and a method called set_password that sets the user’s password. The set_password method should only change the password if the attempted password is different from all the user’s past passwords. It should either print ‘Password changed successfully!’, or ‘Old password cannot be reused, try again.’ Finally, create a method called is_correct that receives a string and returns a boolean True or False depending on whether the string is equal to the current password or not.\nTo initialize the object of the class, use the list below.\nAfter defining the class:\n\nCheck the attribute old_passwords\nCheck the method get_password()\nTry re-setting the password to ‘ibiza1972’, and then check the current password.\nTry re-setting the password to ‘oktoberfest2022’, and then check the current password.\nCheck the is_correct() method\n\n\npast_passwords = ['titanic1911','ibiza1972','montecarlo799']\n\n\nclass PasswordManager:\n    def __init__(self,past_passwords):\n        self.old_passwords = past_passwords\n        \n    def get_password(self):\n        return self.old_passwords[len(self.old_passwords)-1]\n    \n    def set_password(self,new_password):\n        if new_password not in self.old_passwords:\n            self.old_passwords.append(new_password)\n            print(\"Password changed!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Old password cannot be reused, try again.\")\n            \n    def is_correct(self,password):\n        if password == self.old_passwords[len(self.old_passwords)-1]:\n            return True\n        return False\n\npasswd = PasswordManager(past_passwords)",

    "section": "6.3 Inheritance",
    "text": "6.3 Inheritance\nIn object-oriented programming there is a concept called inheritance where we can create a new class that builds off of another class. The new class gets all of the variables and methods of the class it is inheriting from (called the base class). It can then define additional variables and methods that are not present in the base class, and it can also override some of the methods of the base class. That is, it can rewrite them to suit its own purposes. Here is a simple example:\n\nclass Parent:\n    \n    def __init__(self, a, b):\n        self.a = a\n        \n    def method1(self):\n        return self.a+' should study!'\n    \n    def method2(self):\n        return self.a+' does not study enough '\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    \n    def __init__(self, a,b):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n        \n    def method1(self):\n        return self.a+' should play with ' + self.b\n    \n    def method3(self):\n        return self.a + ' does not play enough'\n\nNote that when inheriting from a class, we indicate the parent class in parentheses in the class statement.\nWe see that method1 is present in both the Parent and Child classes, while method2 is only present in the Parent class. Let us understand how does the Child class use the methods of the Parent class, and what happens if a method with the same name is present in both the parent and child classes.\n\np = Parent('Sam', 'John')\nc = Child('Sam','Pam')\nprint('Parent method 1: ', p.method1())\nprint('Parent method 2: ', p.method2())\nprint()\nprint('Child method 1: ', c.method1())\nprint('Child method 2: ', c.method2())\nprint('Child method 3: ', c.method3())\n\nParent method 1:  Sam should study!\nParent method 2:  Sam does not study enough \n\nChild method 1:  Sam should play with Pam\nChild method 2:  Sam does not study enough \nChild method 3:  Sam does not play enough\n\n\nWe see in the example above that the child has overridden the parent’s method1. The child has inherited the parent’s method2, so it can use it without having to define it. The child also adds some features to the parent class, namely a new variable b and a new method, method3.\n\n6.3.1 Practice exercise 2\nDefine a class that inherits the in-built Python class list, and adds a new method to the class called nunique() which returns the number of unique elements in the list.\nDefine the following list as an object of the class you created. Then:\n\nFind the number of unique elements in the object using the method nunique() of the inherited class.\nCheck if the pop() method of the parent class works to pop an element out of the object.\n\n\nlist_ex = [1,2,5,3,6,5,5,5,12]\n\n\nclass list_v2(list):\n    def nuinque(self):\n        unique_elements = []\n        for x in self:\n            if x not in unique_elements:\n                unique_elements.append(x)\n        return len(unique_elements)\n    \nlist_ex = list_v2(list_ex)\nprint(\"Number of unique elements = \", list_ex.nuinque())\nprint(\"Checking the pop() method, the popped out element is\", list_ex.pop())\n\nNumber of unique elements =  6\nChecking the pop() method, the popped out element is 12\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Practice exercise 3\nDefine a class named PasswordManagerUpdated that inherits the class PasswordManager defined in Practice exercise 1. The class PasswordManagerUpdated should have two methods, other than the constructor:\n\nThe method set_password() that sets a new password. The new password must only be accepted if it does not have any punctuations in it, and if it is not the same as one of the old passwords. If the new password is not acceptable, then one of the appropriate messages should be printed - (a) Cannot have punctuation in password, try again, or (b) Old password cannot be reused, try again.\nThe method suggest_password() that randomly sets and returns a password as a string comprising of 15 randomly chosen letters. Letters may be repeated as well.\n\n\nfrom string import punctuation\nimport random as rm\nimport string as st\nclass PasswordManager_updated(PasswordManager):\n    def __init__(self,past_passwords):\n        self.old_passwords = past_passwords.copy()\n    \n    def set_password(self,new_password):\n        if new_password not in self.old_passwords:\n            for punc in punctuation:\n                if punc in new_password:\n                    print(\"Cannot have punctuation in password, try again\")\n                    break\n            self.old_passwords.append(new_password)\n            print(\"password changed!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Old password cannot be reused, try again.\")\n            \n    def suggest_password(self):\n        suggested_passwd = ''\n        for i in range(15):\n            suggested_passwd = suggested_passwd + st.ascii_lowercase[rm.randint(0,26)]\n        self.old_passwords.append(suggested_passwd)           \n        return suggested_passwd",

    "text": "7.4 Converting datatypes\nSometimes a value may have a datatype that is not suitable for using it. For example, consider the variable called annual_income in the code below:\n\nannual_income = \"80000\"\n\nSuppose we wish to divide annual_income by 12 to get the monthly income. We cannot use the variable annual_income directly as its datatype is a string and not a number. Thus, numerical operations cannot be performed on the variable annual_income.\nWe’ll need to convert annual_income to an integer. For that we will use the R’s in-built as.integer() function:\n\nannual_income = as.integer(annual_income)\nmonthly_income = annual_income/12\nprint(paste0(\"monthly income = \", monthly_income))\n\n[1] \"monthly income = 6666.66666666667\"\n\n\nSimilarly, datatypes can be converted from one type to another using in-built R functions as shown below:\n\n#Converting integer to character\nas.character(9)\n\n[1] \"9\"\n\n\n\n#Converting character to numeric\nas.numeric('9.4')\n\n[1] 9.4\n\n\n\n#Converting logical to integer\nas.numeric(FALSE)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nNote that any non-zero numeric value, if converted to the ‘logical’ datatype, will return TRUE, while converting 0 to the ‘logical’ datatype will return FALSE. Only numeric values can be converted to the ‘logical’ datatype.\n\n# Converting integer to logical\nas.logical(40)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n# Converting integer to logical\nas.logical(0)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n# Converting integer to logical\nas.logical(-30.1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nSometimes, conversion of a value may not be possible. For example, it is not possible to convert the variable greeting defined below to a number:\n\ngreeting = \"hello\"\n\nHowever, strings can be concatenated using the paste0() function:\n\npaste0(\"hello\", \" there!\")\n\n[1] \"hello there!\"\n\n\nR’s in-built readline() function can be used to accept an input from the user. For example, suppose we wish the user to input their age:\n\nage = readline(\"Enter your age:\")\n\nEnter your age:\n\n\nThe entered value is stored in the variable age and can be used for computation.",

Let us slice the \\(4^{th}\\), \\(7^{th}\\), and \\(18^{th}\\) elements of the vector vec:\n\nvec[c(4,7,18)]\n\n[1]  4  7 18\n\n\nWe can slice consecutive elements, and non-consecutive elements simultaneously. Let us slice the elements from the \\(4^{th}\\) index to the \\(9^{th}\\) index and the \\(30^{th}\\) and \\(36^{th}\\) element.\n\nvec[c(4:9,30,36)]\n\n[1]  4  5  6  7  8  9 30 36\n\n\n\n\n10.1.1.2 Slicing using a logical atomic vector\nAn atomic vector can be sliced using a logical atomic vector of the same length. The logical atomic vector will have TRUE values corresponding to the indices where the element is to be selected, and FALSE where the element is to be discarded. See the example below.\n\nvec &lt;- 1:5\nvec[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]\n\n[1] 1 4\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Removing elements from atomic vector\nElements can be removed from the vector using the negative sign within [] brackets.\nRemove the 2nd element from the vector:\n\nvec &lt;- 1:5\nvec[-2]\n\n[1] 1 3 4 5\n\n\nIf multiple elements need to be removed, the indices of the elements to be removed can be given as an atomic vector.\nRemove elements 2 to 6 and element 10 from the vector:\n\nvec &lt;- 1:20\nvec[-c(2:6, 10)]\n\n [1]  1  7  8  9 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\n\nExample: USA’s GDP per capita from 1960 to 2021 is given by the vector G in the code chunk below. The values are arranged in ascending order of the year, i.e., the first value is for 1960, the second value is for 1961, and so on. Store the years in which the GDP per capita of the US increased by more than 10%, in a vector.\n\nG = c(3007, 3067, 3244, 3375,3574, 3828, 4146, 4336, 4696, 5032,5234,5609,6094,6726,7226,7801,8592,9453,10565,11674,12575,13976,14434,15544,17121,18237,19071,20039,21417,22857,23889,24342,25419,26387,27695,28691,29968,31459,32854,34515,36330,37134,37998,39490,41725,44123,46302,48050,48570,47195,48651,50066,51784,53291,55124,56763,57867,59915,62805,65095,63028,69288)\n\n\nyears &lt;- c()\nfor (i in 1:(length(G) - 1)) {\n  diff = (G[i+1] - G[i]) / G[i]\n  if (diff &gt; 0.1) years &lt;- c(years, 1960 + i)\n}\nprint(years)\n\n[1] 1973 1976 1977 1978 1979 1981 1984\n\n\n\n\n10.1.3 Element-wise operations on atomic vectors\nWhen we use arithmetic operators like +, -, *, etc., or comparison operators like &gt;, &gt;=, ==, etc., between atomic vectors, then these operators are applied element-wise on the elements of the respective atomic vectors with the same index. Consider the examples below.\n\nvec1 &lt;- 1:4\nvec2 &lt;- 1:4\nvec1 + vec2\n\n[1] 2 4 6 8\n\n\n\nvec1 &gt; vec2\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nIt is highly recommended that these operators be applied on atomic vectors of the same length. Otherwise, the vector of the smaller length will broadcast (or repeat itself) to match the length of the larger vector. A warning will be returned if the length of the longer vector is not a multiple of the length of the shorter vector. Broadcasting may be difficult to interpret, especially when arithmetic operators are being applied on more than 2 atomic vectors of different lengths.\nIf an operator is applied between an atomic vector and a scalar, then the operation is performed on each element of the atomic vector and the scalar. See the examples below.\n\nvec1*4\n\n[1]  4  8 12 16\n\n\n\nvec1 &gt; 2\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\nSuppose, we wish to slice all elements from the object vec that are greater than 2. Here is one approach to do it. We will apply the &gt; operator between vec and 2 to obtain a logical vector that is TRUE on indices where the condition is satisfied, and FALSE otherwise. We will then use this logical vector to slice vec. Below is the code.\n\nvec1[vec1 &gt; 2]\n\n[1] 3 4\n\n\nNow, solve the previous example without using a for loop.\n\n\n10.1.4 The seq() function\nThe seq() function is used to generate an atomic vector consisting of a sequence of integers with a constant gap. For example, the code below generates a sequence of integers starting from 20 upto 60 with gaps of 5.\n\nseq(20, 60, 5)\n\n[1] 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60\n\n\n\n\n10.1.5 The rep() function\nThe rep() function is used to repeat an object a fixed number of times.\n\nrep(4, 10)\n\n [1] 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\n\nrep(c(2, 3), 10)\n\n [1] 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3\n\n\n\n\n10.1.6 The which() function\nThe which() function is used to find the indices of TRUE elements in a logical atomic vector.\n\nvec &lt;- c(8, 3, 4, 7, 9, 7, 5)\n\n\nwhich(vec == 8)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nIn the above code, a logical vector is being created with vec == 8, and the which() function is returning the indices of the TRUE elements.\nThe index of the maximum and minimum values can be found using which.max() and which.min() respectively. In case of multple maximum or minimum elements, the smallest index is returned.\n\nwhich.max(vec)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\nwhich.min(vec)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n10.1.7 Practice exercise 1\nBelow is a vector consisting of responses to the question: “At what age do you think you will marry?” from students of the STAT303-1 Fall 2022 class.\n\nexp_marriage_age &lt;- c('24','30','28','29','30','27','26','28','30+','26','28','30','30','30','probably never','30','25','25','30','28','30+ ','30','25','28','28','25','25','27','28','30','30','35','26','28','27','27','30','25','30','26','32','27','26','27','26','28','37','28','28','28','35','28','27','28','26','28','26','30','27','30','28','25','26','28','35','29','27','27','30','24','25','29','27','33','30','30','25','26','30','32','26','30','30','I wont','25','27','27','25','27','27','32','26','25','never','28','33','28','35','25','30','29','30','31','28','28','30','40','30','28','30','27','by 30','28','27','28','30-35','35','30','30','never','30','35','28','31','30','27','33','32','27','27','26','N/A','25','26','29','28','34','26','24','28','30','120','25','33','27','28','32','30','26','30','30','28','27','27','27','27','27','27','28','30','30','30','28','30','28','30','30','28','28','30','27','30','28','25','never','69','28','28','33','30','28','28','26','30','26','27','30','25','Never','27','27','25')\n\n\n10.1.7.1 Cleaning data\nRemove the elements that are not integers - such as ‘probably never’, ‘30+’, etc. Convert the reamining elements to integer.

    "text": "10.2 Matrix\nMatrices are two-dimensional arrays. The in-built function matrix() is used to define a matrix. An atomic vector can be organized as a matrix by specifying the number of rows and columns.\nFor example, let us define a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns) consisting of consecutive integers fro1 1 to 6.\n\nmat &lt;- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)\nmat\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n\n\nNote that the integers fill up column-wise in the matrix. If we wish to fill-up the matrix by row, we can use the byrow argument.\n\nmat &lt;- matrix(1:6, 2, 3, byrow = TRUE)\nmat\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    2    3\n[2,]    4    5    6\n\n\nThe functions nrow() and ncol() can be used to get the number of rows and columns of the matrix respectively.\n\nnrow(mat)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\nncol(mat)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nMatrices can be sliced using the indices of row and column separated by a , in box brackets. Suppose we wish to get the element in the \\(2^{nd}\\) row and \\(3^{rd}\\) column of the matrix:\n\nmat[2, 3]\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nFor selecting all rows or columns of a matrix, the index for the row/column can be left blank. Suppose we wish to get all the elements of the \\(1^{st}\\) of the matrix:\n\nmat[1, ]\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nRow and columns of the matrix can be sliced using the : operator. Suppose we want to select a sub-matrix that has elements in the first two rows and columns 2 and 3 of the matrix mat:\n\nmat[1:2, 2:3]\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    2    3\n[2,]    5    6\n\n\nElement-wise arithmetic operations can be performed between 2 matrices of the same shape.\n\nmat1 &lt;- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)\nmat2 &lt;- matrix(c(9, 2, 6, 5, 1, 0), 2, 3)\nmat1 + mat2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   10    9    6\n[2,]    4    9    6\n\n\n\nmat1 - mat2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   -8   -3    4\n[2,]    0   -1    6\n\n\nSuppose we need to sum up all the rows of the matrix. We can do it using a for loop as follows:\n\nrow_sum &lt;- c(0,0)\nfor (i in 1:nrow(mat)) {\n  for (j in 1:ncol(mat)) {\n    row_sum[i] &lt;- row_sum[i] + mat[i, j]\n  }\n}\nrow_sum\n\n[1]  6 15\n\n\nObserve that in the above for loop, elements of each row are added one at a time. We can add all the elements of a row simultaneously using the sum() function. This will reduce a for loop from the above code:\n\nrow_sum &lt;- c(0,0)\nfor (i in 1:nrow(mat)){\n  row_sum[i] &lt;- sum(mat[i,])\n}\nrow_sum\n\n[1]  6 15\n\n\nIn the above code, we sum up all the elements of the row simultaneously. However, we still need to sum up the elements of each row one at a time.\n\n10.2.1 The apply() function\nThe apply() function can used to apply a function simultaneously on all rows or columns of a matrix. Thus, this function helps avoid a for loop to iterate over all the rows and columns of the matrix. This reduces the execution time of the code since operations are performed in-parallel, instead of one-at-a-time in a for loop.\nLet us use the apply() function to sum up all the rows of the matrix mat.\n\napply(mat, 1, sum)\n\n[1]  6 15\n\n\nLet us compare the time taken to sum up rows of a matrix using a for loop with the time taken using the apply() function.\n\noptions(digits.secs = 6)\nstart.time &lt;- Sys.time()\nrow_sum&lt;-c(0, 0)\nfor (i in 1:nrow(mat)){\n  row_sum[i] &lt;- sum(mat[i,])\n}\nrow_sum\n\n[1]  6 15\n\nend.time &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime.taken &lt;- end.time - start.time\ntime.taken\n\nTime difference of 0.0046556 secs\n\n\n\nstart.time &lt;- Sys.time()\napply(mat, 1, sum)\n\n[1]  6 15\n\nend.time &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime.taken &lt;- end.time - start.time\ntime.taken\n\nTime difference of 0.001375198 secs\n\n\nObserve that the apply() function takes much lesser time to sum up all the rows of the matrix as compared to the for loop.\nRecall the earlier example where we computed year’s in which the increase in GDP per capita was more than 10%. Let us use matrices to solve the problem. We’ll also compare the time it takes using a matrix with the time it takes using for loops.\n\nstart.time &lt;- Sys.time()\n\n#Let the first column of the matrix be the GDP of all the years except 1960, and the second column be the GDP of all the years except 2021.\nGDP_mat &lt;- matrix(c(G[-1], G[-length(G)]), length(G) - 1, 2)\n\n#The percent increase in GDP can be computed by performing computations using the 2 columns of the matrix\ninc &lt;- (GDP_mat[,1] - GDP_mat[,2]) / GDP_mat[,2]\nyears &lt;- 1961:2021\nyears &lt;- years[inc &gt; 0.1]\nyears\n\n[1] 1973 1976 1977 1978 1979 1981 1984\n\nend.time &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime.taken &lt;- end.time - start.time\ntime.taken\n\nTime difference of 0.003884792 secs\n\n\nWithout matrices, the time taken to perform the same computation is measured with the code below.\n\nstart.time &lt;- Sys.time()\nyears &lt;- c()\nfor (i in 1:(length(G) - 1)) {\n  diff = (G[i+1] - G[i]) / G[i]\n  if (diff &gt; 0.1) years &lt;- c(years, 1960 + i)\n}\nprint(years)\n\n[1] 1973 1976 1977 1978 1979 1981 1984\n\n#print(proc.time()[3]-start_time)\nend.time &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime.taken &lt;- end.time - start.time\ntime.taken\n\nTime difference of 0.007493019 secs\n\n\nObserve that matrices reduce the execution time of the code as computations are performed simultaneously, in contrast to a for loop where computations are performed one at a time.\nSometimes, the computations on rows / columns of a matrix are not straighforward and we may need to use the apply() function to apply a function on each row / column of a matrix.\nExample: Find the maximum GDP per capita of the US in each of the 5 year periods starting from 1961-1965, and upto 2015-2020.\n\nGDP_5year &lt;- matrix(G[-c(1, length(G))], 12, 5, byrow = TRUE)\nGDP_max_5year &lt;- apply(GDP_5year, 1, max)\n\nIn the above code, we applied the in-built function max on all the rows. Sometimes, an in-built function may not be available for the computations to be performed. In such as case, we can write our own user-defined function within the apply() function. See the example below.\nExample: Find the range (max-min) of GDP per capita of the US in each of the 5 year periods starting from 1961-1965, and upto 2015-2020.\n\nGDP_5year &lt;- matrix(G[-c(1, length(G))], 12, 5, byrow = TRUE)\nGDP_range_5year &lt;- apply(GDP_5year, 1, function(x) max(x) - min(x))\nGDP_range_5year\n\n [1]  761 1088 2192 3983 4261 4818 4349 6362 6989 2349 6697 7228\n\n\nIn the code above we applied a user-defined function on each row of the matrix. However, if the function has multiple lines, it may be inconvenient to write the function within the apply() function. In that case, we can define the function outside the apply() function.\nExample: Find the five year periods starting from 1961-1965, and upto 2016-2020, during which the GDP per capita decreased as compared to the previous year.\n\nGDP_inc &lt;- function (GDP_5yr) {\n  dec &lt;- 0\n  for (i in 1:4) {\n    if(GDP_5yr[i+1] &lt; GDP_5yr[i]) dec &lt;- 1\n  }\n  return(dec)\n}\n\nGDP_5year_mat &lt;- matrix(G[-c(1,length(G))], 12, 5, byrow = TRUE)\nyears_inc_dec &lt;- apply(GDP_5year_mat, 1, GDP_inc)\nfive_year_periods &lt;- seq(1960, 2015, 5)\nprint(\"Five year periods in which the GDP per capita decreased are those starting from the years:\")\n\n[1] \"Five year periods in which the GDP per capita decreased are those starting from the years:\"\n\nprint(five_year_periods[years_inc_dec == 1] + 1)\n\n[1] 2006 2016\n\n\nThe 5 year periods during which the GDP per capita decreased as compared to the previous year are 2006-2010, and 2016-2020.\n\n\n10.2.2 Practice exercise 3\nFind the 5 year period in which the difference of the maximum GDP per capita and the minimum GDP per capita as a percentage of the minimum GDP per capita was the highest.\nSolution:\n\nfive_year_periods[which.max(apply(GDP_5year_mat, 1, function(x) (max(x) - min(x)) / min(x)))] + 1\n\n[1] 1976\n\n\n\nprint(\"During 1976-1980 the difference of the maximum GDP per capita and the minimum GDP per capita as a percentage of the minimum GDP per capita was the highest.\")\n\n[1] \"During 1976-1980 the difference of the maximum GDP per capita and the minimum GDP per capita as a percentage of the minimum GDP per capita was the highest.\"\n\n\n\n\n10.2.3 Practice exercise 4\nThe object country_names is an atomic vector consisting of country names. The object coordinates_capital_cities is a matrix consisting of the latitude-longitude pair of the capital city of the respective country. The order of countries in country_names is the same as the order in which their capital city coordinates (latitude-longitude) appear in the matrix coordinates_capital_cities.\nDownload the file capital_cities.csv from here. Make sure the file is in your current working directory. Execute the following code to obtain the objects coordinates_capital_cities and country_names.\n\ncapital_cities &lt;- read.csv('capital_cities.csv')\ncoordinates_capital_cities &lt;- as.matrix(capital_cities[,c(3, 4)])\ncountry_names &lt;- capital_cities[,1]\n\n\n10.2.3.1 Country with capital closest to DC\nPrint the name and coordinates of the country with the capital city closest to the US capital - Washington DC.\nNote that:\n\nThe Country Name for US is given as United States in the data.\nThe ‘closeness’ of capital cities from the US capital is based on the Euclidean distance of their coordinates to those of the US capital.\n\nHint:\n\nGet the coordinates of Washington DC from coordinates_capital_cities. The row that contains the coordinates of DC will have the same index as United States has in the vector country_names\nCreate a matrix that has coordinates of Washington DC in each row, and has the same number of rows as the matrix coordinates_capital_cities.\nSubtract coordinates_capital_cities from the matrix created in (2). Element-wise subtraction will occur between the matrices.\nUse the apply() function on the matrix obtained above to find the Euclidean distance of Washington DC from the rest of the capital cities.\nUsing the distances obtained above, find the country that has the closest capital to DC.\n\n\n\n10.2.3.2 Top 10 countries closest to DC\n\nPrint the names of the countries of the top 10 capital cities closest to the US capital - Washington DC.\nCreate and print a matrix containing the coordinates of the top 10 capital cities closest to Washington DC.\n\n\nUS_index = which(country_names == 'United States')\ndc_coord &lt;- coordinates_capital_cities[US_index,]\ndistances_to_DC &lt;- apply(coordinates_capital_cities, 1, function(x) sqrt(sum((x - dc_coord)**2)))\nnum_of_countries &lt;- length(country_names)\ndistances_to_DC_matrix &lt;- cbind(1:num_of_countries, distances_to_DC)\nsorted &lt;- distances_to_DC_matrix[order(distances_to_DC_matrix[,2]),]\n\nTop 10 countries with capitals closest to Washington DC are the following:\n\ncountry_names[sorted[3:12, 1]]\n\nThe coordinates of the top 10 capital cities closest to Washington DC are:\n\ncoordinates_capital_cities[sorted[3:12, 1],]",

    "text": "10.3 Lists\nAtomic vectors and matrices are quite useful in R. However, a constraint with them is that they can only contain objects of the same datatype. For example, an atomic vector can contain all numeric objects, all character objects, or all logical objects, but not a mixture of multiple types of objects. Thus, there arises a need for a list data structure that can store objects of multiple datatypes.\nA list can be defined using the list() function. For example, consider the list below:\n\nlist_ex &lt;- list(1, \"apple\", TRUE, list(\"another list\", TRUE))\n\nThe list list_ex consists of objects of mutiple datatypes. The length of the list can be obtained using the length()function:\n\nlength(list_ex)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nA list is an ordered collection of objects. Each object of the list is associated with an index that corresponds to its order of occurrence in the list.\nA single element can be sliced from the list by specifying its index within the [[]] operator.

    "text": "11.1 Recursion\nRecursion is a method of solving a problem by dividing it into smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. This forms a loop, where every time the function is called, it calls itself again and again. However, every time the function calls itself, it checks certain condition(s) which are the stopping condition(s). When such condition(s) are true the function will stop calling itself. These conditions are called the base case of the recursive function.\nEvery recursive function must have at least two cases:\n1. Base case: This is the simplest case that can be answered directly, and the function does not call itself.\n2. Recursive case: This is a relatively more complex case that cannot be answered directly, but can be described as a smaller instance of the same problem. In this case, the function calls itself to answer the smaller problem.\nBelow is an example, where we defined a function that computes the factorial of an integer by recursion.\nfactorial&lt;-function(n)\n{\n  if(n==1)      #Base case\n  {\n      return(1)  \n  }        \n  return(n*factorial(n-1)) #Recursive case\n}\nfactorial(5)\n\n[1] 120\nIn the above example, the case \\(n=1\\) is the base case, where the function does not need to call itself, and returns 1. All other cases, where \\(n&gt;1\\), and \\(n \\in  \\mathbb{Z}\\) are recursive cases, where the function calls itself with a smaller instance of the same problem.\nA recursive function must satisfy the following conditions:\nExample: Write a recursive function that returns the \\(n^{th}\\) term of the Fibonacci sequence, where \\(n\\) is an integer, and \\(n&gt;0\\). In a Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the preceding two numbers, and the sequence starts from \\(0,1\\). The sequence is as follows:\n\\(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...\\)\nfibonacci&lt;-function(n)\n{\n  if(n==0 | n==1){  #Base case\n    return(n)\n  }\n  return(fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2))  #Recursive case\n}\n#The function `fibonacci` prints the n+1th term of the fibonacci sequence when `n` is passed as an argument. Thus, we need to reduce `n` by 1 to print the nth term of the sequence. The function `nth_term` reduces `n` by 1 before passing `n` to the function `fibonacci()`.\nnth_term&lt;-function(N)\n{\n  fibonacci(N-1)\n}\nnth_term(7)\n\n[1] 8",

Recursive solutions can be easy to read and understand as compared to the corresponding iterative solution.\nOne downside of recursion is that it may take more space than an iterative solution. Building up a stack of recursive calls consumes memory temporarily, and the stack is limited in size, which may become a limit on the size of the problem that the recursive implementation can solve.",

Since the number of rabbits and foxes cannot be floating-point numbers, use the in-built python function round() to round-off the calculated values to integers.

    "text": "B.3 Binary search\n\nB.3.1 Word search\nThe tuple named as tuple_of_words (find it in the template) consists of words. Write a function that accepts a word, say word_to_search and the tuple_of_words as arguments, and finds if the word_to_search occurs in the tuple_of_words or not. This is very simple to do with the code word_to_search in tuple_of_words. However, this code is unfortunately very slow.\nAs the words in the tuple_of_words are already sorted in alphabetical order, we can search using a faster way, called binary search. To implement binary search in a function, start by comparing word_to_search with the middle entry in the tuple_of_words. If they are equal, then you are done and the function should return True. On the other hand, if the word_to_search comes before the middle entry, then search the first half of tuple_of_words. If it comes after the middle entry, then search the second half of tuple_of_words. Then repeat the process on the appropriate half of the tuple_of_words and continue until the word is found or there is nothing left to search, in which case the function short return False. The &lt; and &gt; operators can be used to alphabetically compare two strings.\nYou may write just one function or multiple functions to solve this problem.\nCheck your function if the word_to_search is: 1. 'rocket' 2. 'rest' 3. 'ambush'\n(25 points)\n\n\nB.3.2 Iterations to find the word\nUpdate the function in B.3.1 to also print the number of iterations it took to find the word_to_search or fail in finding the word_to_search.\nCheck your function if the word_to_search is: 1.

For example, the index of ‘abacus’ is 0, the index of ‘abdomen’ is 1, and so on.\nCheck your function if the 'word_to_search' is: 1. 'rocket' 2. 'unburned' 3. 'ambush'\n(10 points)\n\n\nB.3.4 Maximum iterations\nWhat is the maximum number of iterations it may take for your function to search or fail in searching the word_to_search.

However, it will have the following differences as compared to the parent class:\n\nInstantiation\n\nDuring instantiation, it will initialize two additional attributes - spam_words, and update_words, along with the messages attribute which stores existing messages. Use the lists below to initialize the attributes of the class.\nEach message will be tagged as spam, update, or personal as follows. If the message contains any word / phrase in the list spam_words, then it will be tagged as spam. If the message is not tagged as spam, and it contains any word / phrase in the list update_words, then it will be tagged as update. If the message has not been tagged as spam or update, then it will be tagged as personal. The tag will appear as an additional key-value pair in the dictionary of each message, where the key will be tag, and the value will be 'spam', 'update' or 'personal'. Words / phrases must be identified as spam / update irrespective of the case of the word.

    "text": "E.3 Air quality sensors\nAir quality sensors are used to measure the amount of contaminants in air. This question will guide you in finding the location of installing 50 air quality sensors in the State of Colorado, such that they are as far away from each other as possible. The approach below is a greedy algorithm to find an approximate Maximin design.\nUse the following code to generate the coordinate-pairs (latitude and longitude) of potential locations for installing an air quality sensor in Colorado:\n\nx1&lt;-seq(37,41,length=100)\nx2&lt;-seq(102,109,length=100)\ncandidate_set&lt;-as.matrix(expand.grid(x1,x2))\n\n\nE.3.1 Number of coordinate-pairs\nHow many coordinate-pairs are there in the object candidate_set?\nNote that:\n\nA coordinate-pair means a latitude-longitude pair.\n‘Air quality sensor’ will be referred as ‘sensor’ in the questions below for brevity.\n\n(2 points)\n\n\nE.3.2 First sensor\nThe first sensor is to be installed closest to Denver (closest in terms of Euclidean distance). Find the coordinate-pair of the location where the first sensor will be installed. The coordinate-pair of Denver is: [39.7392\\(^{\\circ}\\) N, 104.9903\\(^{\\circ}\\) W]\nNote that the suffixes \\(^{\\circ}\\) N and \\(^{\\circ}\\) W are omitted in the object candidate_set.\n(6 points)\n\n\nE.3.3 Second sensor\nFind the coordinate-pair of the installation of the next sensor, such that it is as far as possible from the first sensor installed near Denver.\n(6 points)\n\n\nE.3.4 Air sensor coordinates\nUse the rbind() function to stack the coordinate-pairs of the first and second sensors vertically to obtain a 2 x 2 matrix. Name the matrix as air_sensor_coordinates.\nRun the code below to check if your results seem correct. The coordinate-pairs of the two air quality sensors will be marked as black dots over the map of Colorado. Make sure the file colorado.png is in the same directory as the *qmd file.\n\nlibrary(png)\nif(!require(png)){\n  install.packages(\"png\")\n  library(png)\n}\nlibrary(png)\nmy_image &lt;- readPNG(\"colorado.png\")\nplot(-x2,x1, type='n', main=\"\", xlab=\"longitude\", ylab=\"latitude\")\nrasterImage(my_image, xleft=-109, xright=-102, ybottom=37, ytop=41)\npoints(-air_sensor_coordinates[,2],air_sensor_coordinates[,1],pch=16)\n\n(4 points)\n\n\nE.3.5 Third sensor\nNow you need to find the coordinate-pair for installing the third sensor such that it is far away from the two already-installed sensors. Proceed as follows:\n\nFind the minimum distance of each coordinate-pair in candidate_set from the two already installed sensors. For example, if a coordinate-pair is at a distance of 5 units from the first sensor, and 10 units from the second sensor, then its minimum distance from the sensors will be \\(\\min(5,10) = 5\\) units.\nSelect the coordinate-pair (from candidate_set) whose minimum distance from the two already installed sensors is the maximum.\nStack the coordinate-pair of the third air quality sensor vertically on the array air_sensor_coordinates.\n\nExecute the code provided in the previous question to check if your results seem correct. The coordinate-pairs of the three air quality sensors will be marked as black dots over the map of Colorado.\nHint:\nFor step (1) above:\n\nDefine a function which computes the distances of a coordinate-pair from all the coordinates of air_sensor_coordinates, and returns the minimum distance.\nApply the function on all the coordinate-pairs in candidate_set using the apply() function.\n\n(15 points)\n\n\nE.3.6 47 more sensors\nYou need to find 47 more coordinate-pairs to install air quality sensors well-spread across Colorado. We will generalize the steps in the previous question as follows:\n\nSuppose you have already found the coordinate-pairs for the installation of i sensors.\nFind the minimum distance of each coordinate in candidate_set from the i already installed sensors. For example, if a coordinate-pair is at a distance of \\(d_1\\) from the first sensor, \\(d_2\\) from the second sensor,…, and \\(d_i\\) from the \\(i^{th}\\) sensor, then its minimum distance from the sensors will be \\(min(d_1, d_2, ..., d_i\\)).\nSelect the \\(i+1^{th}\\) coordinate-pair (from candidate_set) as the one whose minimum distance from the \\(i\\) already installed sensors is the maximum. Execute the code provided in the previous question to check if your results seem correct. You should see 50 black dots well spread across Colorado.\n\n(6 points)",
