You can access Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda Navigator, or directly open the Jupyter Notebook application itself. It should automatically open up in your default browser. The figure below shows a Jupyter Notebook opened with Google Chrome. This page is called the landing page of the notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new notebook, click on the New button and select the Python 3 option. You should see a blank notebook as in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Writing and executing code\nCode cell: By default, a cell is of type Code, i.e., for typing code, as seen as the default choice in the dropdown menu below the Widgets tab. Try typing a line of python code (say, 2+3) in an empty code cell and execute it by pressing Shift+Enter. This should execute the code, and create an new code cell. Pressing Ctlr+Enter for Windows (or Cmd+Enter for Mac) will execute the code without creating a new cell.\nCommenting code in a code cell: Comments should be made while writing the code to explain the purpose of the code or a brief explanation of the tasks being performed by the code. A comment can be added in a code cell by preceding it with a # sign. For example, see the comment in the code below.\nWriting comments will help other users understand your code. It is also useful for the coder to keep track of the tasks being performed by their code.\n\n#This code adds 3 and 5\n3+5\n\n8\n\n\nMarkdown cell: Although a comment can be written in a code cell, a code cell cannot be used for writing headings/sub-headings, and is not appropriate for writing lengthy chunks of text. In such cases, change the cell type to Markdown from the dropdown menu below the Widgets tab. Use any markdown cheat sheet found online, for example, this one to format text in the markdown cells.\nGive a name to the notebook by clicking on the text, which says ‘Untitled’.\n\n\n1.2.3 Saving and loading notebooks\nSave the notebook by clicking on File, and selecting Save as, or clicking on the Save and Checkpoint icon (below the File tab). Your notebook will be saved as a file with an exptension ipynb. This file will contain all the code as well as the outputs, and can be loaded and edited by a Jupyter user. To load an existing Jupyter notebook, navigate to the folder of the notebook on the landing page, and then click on the file to open it.\n\n\n1.2.4 Rendering notebook as HTML\nWe’ll use Quarto to print the **.ipynb* file as HTML. Check the procedure for rendering a notebook as HTML here. You have several options to format the file.\nYou will need to open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the command: quarto render filename.ipynb --to html."

However, these functions will typically be insufficient for a analyzing data. Some of the popular libraries in data science and their primary purposes are as follows:\n\nNumPy: Performing numerical operations and efficiently storing numerical data.\nPandas: Reading, cleaning and manipulating data.\nMatplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizing data.\nSciPy: Performing scientific computing such as solving differential equations, optimization, statistical tests, etc.\nScikit-learn: Data pre-processing and machine learning, with a focus on prediction.\nStatsmodels: Developing statistical models with a focus on inference\n\nA library can be imported using the import keyword. For example, a NumPy library can be imported as:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nUsing the as keyboard, the NumPy library has been given the name np. All the functions and attributes of the library can be called using the ‘np.’ prefix. For example, let us generate a sequence of whole numbers upto 10 using the NumPy function arange():\n\nnp.arange(8)\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n\nGenerating random numbers is very useful in python for performing simulations (we’ll see in later chapters). The library random is used to generate random numbers such as integers, real numbers based on different probability distributions, etc.\nBelow is an example of using the randint() function of the library for generating random numbers in [a, b], where a and b are integers.\n\nimport random as rm\nrm.randint(5,10) #This will generate a random number in [5,10]\n\n7"

However, the value of x can be changed:\n\nx = 3\nprint(\"x =\", x)\n\nx = 3\n\n\nThus, the object x in the above code is a variable that refers to a memory location storing the constant value of 3.\n\n2.2.1 Variable names\nThere are a some rules for naming variables:\n\nA variable name must start with a letter or underscore _\nA variable name may consist of letters, numbers, and underscores only\n\nFor example, some of the valid variable names are *salary, text10, _varname. Some of the invalid variable names are salary% 10text, varname)*\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. For example, the variable Varname will be different from varname.\nThere are certain reserved words in python that have some meaning, and cannot be used as variable names. These reserved words are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest coding practice: Variables should be named such that they are informative of the value they are storing. For example, suppose we wish to compute the income tax a person has to pay based on their income and tax rate. Below are two ways of naming variables to do this computation:\n\nincome = 80000\ntax_rate = 0.15\nprint(\"Income tax = \",income*tax_rate)\n\nIncome tax =  12000.0\n\n\n\na = 80000\nb = 0.15\nprint(\"Income tax = \",a*b)\n\nIncome tax =  12000.0\n\n\nThe former code chuck is better than the latter one as it makes the code easy to read and understand.\n\n\n2.2.2 Practice exercise 2\n\n2.2.2.1 Variables or constants?\nIn the statements below, classify the objects as variables or constants?\n\nvalue = “name”\nconstant = 7\nanother_const = “variable”\nTrue_False = True\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Valid variable names?\nWhich of the following variable names are valid?\n\nvar.name\nvar9name\n_varname\nvarname*"

For example, consider the variable called annual_income in the code below:\n\nannual_income = \"80000\"\n\nSuppose we wish to divide annual_income by 12 to get the monthly income. We cannot use the variable monthly_income directly as its datatype is a string and not a number. Thus, numerical operations cannnot be performed on the variable annual_income.\nWe’ll need to convert annual_income to an integer. For that we will use the python’s in-built int() function:\n\nannual_income = int(annual_income)\nmonthly_income = annual_income/12\nprint(\"monthly income = \", monthly_income)\n\nmonthly income =  6666.666666666667\n\n\nSimilarly, datatypes can be converted from one type to another using in-built python functions as shown below:\n\n#Converting integer to string\nstr(9)\n\n'9'\n\n\n\n#Converting string to float\nfloat(\"4.5\")\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n#Converting bool to integer\nint(True)\n\n1\n\n\nSometimes, conversion of a value may not be possible. For example, it is not possible to convert the variable greeting defined below to a number:\n\ngreeting = \"hello\"\n\nHowever, in some cases, mathematical operators such as + and * can be applied on strings. The operator + concatenates multiple strings, while the operator * can be used to concatenate a string to itself multiple times:\n\n\"Hi\" + \" there!\"\n\n'Hi there!'\n\n\n\n\"5\" + '3'\n\n'53'\n\n\n\n\"5\"*8\n\n'55555555'"

    "text": "2.8 Programming errors\nThere are 3 types of errors that can occur in a program - syntax errors, run-time errors, and semantic errors.\n\n2.8.1 Syntax errors\nSyntax errors occur if the code is written in a way that it does not comply with the rules / standards / laws of the language (python in this case). For example, suppose a values is assigned to a variable as follows:\n\n9value = 2\n\nThe above code when executed will indicate a syntax error as it violates the rule that a variable name must not start with a number.\n\n\n2.8.2 Run-time errors\nRun-time errors occur when a code is syntactically correct, but there are other issues with the code such as:\n\nMisspelled or incorrectly capitalized variable and function names\nAttempts to perform operations (such as math operations) on data of the wrong type (ex. attempting to subtract two variables that hold string values)\nDividing by zero\nAttempts to use a type conversion function such as int on a value that can’t be converted to an int\n\nFor example, suppose a number is multipled as follws:\n\nmultiplication_result = x * 4\n\nThe above code is syntactically correct. However, it will generate an error as the variable x has not been defined as a number.\n\n\n2.8.3 Semantic errors\nSemantic errors occur when the code executes without an error being indicated by the compiler. However, it does not work as inteded by the user. For example, consider the following code of mutiplying the number 6 by 3:\n\nx = '6'\nx * 3\n\n'666'\n\n\nIf it was intended to multiply the number 6, then the variable x should have been defined as x=6 so that x has a value of type integer. However, in the above code 6 is a string type value. When a string is multiplied by an integer, say n, it concatenates with itself n times.\n\n\n2.8.4 Practice exercise 6\nSuppose we wish to compute tax using the income and the tax rate. Identify the type of error from amongst syntax error, semantic error and run-time error in the following pieces of code.\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 * Income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 x income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 ** income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)"

    "text": "3.1 Conditonal execution\nThe first type of control flow satement is if-elif-else. This statement helps with conditional execution of code, i.e., the piece of code to be executed is selected based on certain condition(s).\n\n3.1.1 Comparison operators\nFor testing if conditions are true or false, first we need to learn the operators that can be used for comparison. For example, suppose we want to check if two objects are equal, we use the == operator:\n\n5==6\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nx = \"hi\"\ny = \"hi\"\nx==y\n\nTrue\n\n\nBelow are the python comparison operators and their meanings.\n\n\n\nPython code\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nx==y\nProduce True if … x is equal to y\n\n\nx != y\n… x is not equal to y\n\n\nx > y\n… x is greater than y\n\n\nx < y\n… x is less than y\n\n\nx >= y\n… x is greater than or equal to y\n\n\nx <= y\n… x is less than or equal to y\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Logical operators\nSometimes we may need to check multiple conditions simultaneously. The logical operator and is used to check if all the conditions are true, while the logical operator or is used to check if either of the conditons is true.\n\n#Checking if both the conditions are true using 'and'\n5==5 and 67==68\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n#Checking if either condition is true using 'or'\nx = 6; y = 90\nx<0 or y>50\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 if-elif-else statement\nThe if-elif-else statements can check several conditions, and execute the code corresponding to the condition that is true. Note that there can be as many elif statements as required.\nSyntax: Python uses indentation to identify the code to be executed if a condition is true. All the code indented within a condition is executed if the condition is true.\nExample: Input an integer. Print whether it is positive or negative.\n\nnumber = input(\"Enter a number:\")  #Input an integer\nnumber_integer = int(number)       #Convert the integer to 'int' datatype\nif number_integer>0:               #Check if the integer is positive\n    print(\"Number is positive\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is negative\")\n\nEnter a number:-9\nNumber is negative\n\n\nIn the above code, note that anything entered by the user is taken as a string datatype by python. However, a string cannot be positive or negative. So, we converted the number input by the user to integer to check if it was positive or negative.\nThere may be multiple statements to be executed if a condition is true. See the example below.\nExample: Input a number. Print whether it is positive, negative or zero. If it is negative, print its absolute value.\n\nnumber = input(\"Enter a number:\")\nnumber_integer = int(number)\nif number_integer>0:\n    print(\"Number is positive\")\nelif number_integer==0:\n    print(\"Number is zero\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is negative\")\n    print(\"Absolute value of number = \", abs(number_integer))\n\nEnter a number:0\nNumber is zero\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Practice exercise 1\nInput a number. Print whether its odd or even.\n\n\n3.1.5 Try-except\nIf we suspect that some lines of code may produce an error, we can put them in a try block, and if an error does occur, we can use the except block to instead execute an alternative piece of code. This way the program will not stop if an error occurs within the try block, and instead will be directed to execute the code within the except block.\nExample: Input an integer from the user. If the user inputs a valid integer, print whether it is a multiple of 3. However, if the user does not input a valid integer, print a message saying that the input is invalid.\n\nnum = input(\"Enter an integer:\")\n\n#The code lines within the 'try' block will execute as long as they run without error  \ntry:\n    #Converting the input to integer, as user input is a string\n    num_int = int(num)  \n    \n    #checking if the integer is a multiple of 3\n    if num_int%3==0:            \n        print(\"Number is a multiple of 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Number is not a multiple of 3\")\n        \n#The code lines within the 'except' block will execute only if the code lines within the 'try' block throw an error        \nexcept:\n    print(\"Input must be an integer\")\n\nEnter an integer:hi\nInput must be an integer\n\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Practice exercise 2\n\n3.1.6.1 \nAsk the user to enter their exam score. Print the grade based on their score as follows:\n\n\n\nScore\nGrade\n\n\n\n\n(90,100]\nA\n\n\n(80,90]\nB\n\n\n[0,80]\nC\n\n\n\nIf the user inputs a score which is not a number, print “Exam score must be a number”. If the input is a number, but not in [0,100], print “Exam score must be in [0, 100]”.\n\n\n3.1.6.2 \nNested if-elif-else statements: This question will lead you to create nested if statements, i.e., an if statement within another if statement.\nThink of a number in [1,5]. Ask the user to guess the number.\n\nIf the user guesses the number correctly, print “Correct in the first attempt!”, and stop the program. Otherwise, print “Incorrect! Try again” and give them another chance to guess the number.\nIf the user guesses the number correctly in the second attempt, print “Correct in the second attempt”, otherwise print “Incorrect in both the attempts, the correct number is:”, and print the correct number."

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nAs the words suggests, functions are a piece of code that have a specific function or purpose. As an analogy, if a human is a computer program, then the mind can be considered to be a function, which has purpose of thinking, eyes can be another function, which have a purpose of seeing. These functions are called upon by the human when needed.\nSimilarly, in case of a computer program, functions are a piece of code, that perform a specific task, when called upon by the program. Instead of being defined as a function, the piece of code can also be used directly whenever it is needed in a program. However, defining a frequently-used piece of code as a function has the following benefits:\n\nIt reduces the number of lines of code, as the lines of code need to be written just once in the function definition. Thereafter, the function is called by its name, wherever needed in the program. This makes the code compact, and enhances readability.\nIt makes the process of writing code easier, as the user needs to just type the name of the function, wherever it is needed, instead of pasting lines of code.\nIt can be used in different programs, thereby saving time in writing other programs.\n\nTo put it more formally, a function is a piece of code that takes arguments (if any) as input, performs computations or tasks, and then returns a result or results."

However, sometimes we may wish to define a function that takes input(s), and performs computations on the inputs to produce an output. These input(s) are called parameter(s) of a function. When a function is called, the value(s) of these parameter(s) must be specified as argument(s) to the function.\n\n4.3.1 Function with a parameter\nLet us change the previous example to write a function that takes an integer as an input argument, and prints whether it is odd or even:\n\n#This is an example of a function definition that has an argument\ndef odd_even(num):           \n    if num%2==0:\n        print(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Odd\")\n\nWe can use the function whenever we wish to find a number is odd or even. For example, if we wish to find that a number input by the user is odd or even, we can call the function with the user input as its argument.\n\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter an integer:\"))\nodd_even(number)\n\nEnter an integer:6\nEven\n\n\nNote that the above function needs an argument as per the function definition. It will produce an error if called without an argument:\n\nodd_even()\n\nTypeError: odd_even() missing 1 required positional argument: 'num'\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Function with a parameter having a default value\nTo avoid errors as above, sometimes is a good idea to assign a default value to the parameter in the function definition:\n\n#This is an example of a function definition that has an argument with a default value\ndef odd_even(num=0):           \n    if num%2==0:\n        print(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Odd\")\n\nNow, we can call the function without an argument. The function will use the default value of the parameter specified in the function definition.\n\nodd_even()\n\nEven\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Function with multiple parameters\nA function can have as many parameters as needed. Multiple parameters/arguments are separated by commas. For example, below is a function that inputs two strings, concatenates them with a space in between, and prints the output:\n\ndef concat_string(string1, string2):\n    print(string1+' '+string2)\n\n\nconcat_string(\"Hi\", \"there\")\n\nHi there\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Practice exercise 1\nWrite a function that prints prime numbers between two real numbers - a and b, where a and b are the parameters of the function. Call the function and check the output with a = 60, b = 80."

Thus, typically, we return an object from the function definition, which consists of the information we may need in the future.\nThe example odd_even can be updated to return the text “odd” or “even” as shown below:\n\n#This is an example of a function definition that has an argument with a default value, and returns an object\ndef odd_even(num=0):           \n    if num%2==0:\n        return(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        return(\"Odd\")\n\nThe function above returns a string “Odd” or “Even”, depending on whether the number is odd or even. This result can be stored in a variable, which can be used later.\n\nresponse=odd_even(3)\nresponse\n\n'Odd'\n\n\nThe variable response now refers to the object where the string “Odd” or “Even” is stored.

For example, a NumPy library can be imported as:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nUsing the as keyboard, the NumPy library has been given the name np. All the functions and attributes of the library can be called using the ‘np.’ prefix. For example, let us generate a sequence of whole numbers upto 10 using the NumPy function arange():\n\nnp.arange(8)\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n\nGenerating random numbers is very useful in python for performing simulations (we’ll see in later chapters). The library random is used to generate random numbers such as integers, real numbers based on different probability distributions, etc.\nBelow is an example of using the randint() function of the library for generating random numbers in [a, b], where a and b are integers.\n\nimport random as rm\nrm.randint(5,10) #This will generate a random number in [5,10]\n\n7\n\n\n\n4.7.1 Practice exercise 2\nGenerate a random number between [-5,5].

How many foxes should be there at \\(t = 0\\) (i.e., what should be \\(f_0\\)), such that the rabbit species survives (i.e., \\(r_{t\\_max}>0\\)) for the maximum possible number of years (\\(t_{max}\\)) before becoming extinct (i.e., \\(r_{t\\_max+1} = 0\\)). Also, find the maximum possible number of years (i.e., \\(t_{max}\\)) the rabbit species will survive.\nModify the program in the previous question to compute the answers to the above questions, and print the following statement, with the blanks filled:\nIf there are ___ foxes at t = 0, the rabbit species will survive for ___ years, which is the maximum possible number of years the rabbits can survive.\nNote: Use the same values of \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\), and \\(\\delta\\) as in the previous question.\nHint:\n\nConsider values of \\(f_0\\) starting from 1, and upto a large number, say 1000.\nFor each value of \\(f_0\\), find the number of years for which the rabbit species survives.\nFind the value of \\(f_0\\) and \\(t\\) for which the rabbit species surives the maximum number of years, i.e., \\(t = t_{max}\\).\n\n(20 points)\n\n\nA.6.3 Saving rabbits from extinction\nWhat must be the minimum number of rabbits, and the corresponding number of foxes at \\(t = 0\\), such that the rabbit and fox species never become extinct.\nNote: Use the same values of \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\), and \\(\\delta\\) as in the previous question.\nHint:\n\nConsider \\(r_0 = 1\\), and then keep increasing \\(r_0\\) by 1 if it’s not possible for the rabbit species to survive with the value of \\(r_0\\) under consideration.\nFor each \\(r_0\\), consider number of foxes starting from \\(f_0 = 1\\), and upto a large number, say \\(f_0 = 200\\).\nAs soon as you find a combination of \\(r_0\\) and \\(f_0\\), such that there is no change in \\(r_t\\) and \\(f_t\\) for 2 consecutive years, you have found the values of \\(r_0\\) and \\(f_0\\), such that both the species maintain their numbers and never become extinct. At this point, print the result, and stop the program (break out of all loops).\n\nModify the program in the previous question to answer the above question, and print the following statement with the blanks filled:\nFor ___ foxes, and ___ rabbits at t = 0, the fox and rabbit species will never be extinct.\n(25 points)"
