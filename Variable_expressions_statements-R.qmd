## Data Types

Some of the commonly used objects in R are numbers - integer and double (or numeric), character and logical (TRUE/FALSE). The data type of the object can be identified using the in-built R function `class()`. For example, see the following objects and their types:

```{r}
class(4)
```


```{r}
class(4.4)
```


```{r}
class('4')
```

```{r}
class(TRUE)
```
